  "Bio": {
    "p1": "Born in Auxerre, I spent my childhood with my family in Orleans and at the age of 19 I went to Lille to study business.",
    "p2": "In 2012, I decided to embark on an epic 15,000-kilometer journey by bicycle from France through Europe, Russia and Asia to India. The whole journey taking a year to complete the circuit from Lille to Mumbai.",
    "p3": "Although freshly graduated, I was still filled with images of my bike trip so I decided to go and live in Australia. I stayed there for almost three years, taking on all kinds of jobs, bartenders, slaughterhouses, construction and finance.",
    "p4": "It was also in Australia that I started to develop my passion for photography. During my last 6 months there I looked for resources and began training myself on the technical aspects, the rules of composition and editing.",
    "p5": "My photographic style was still being refined when I arrived in the Philippines. Alone in the streets of Manila I explored the city in every nook and cranny finding myself confronted with the harsh reality of life on the edges. However, at the same time I experienced beautiful meetings there discovering a people of kindness and generosity that I had not seen anywhere else. Very quickly I decided to focus my work on the inhabitants of Manila, on scenes of life and emotion.",
    "p6": "Manila, which was originally just a place of passage on my way back to France, has become my place of life."
